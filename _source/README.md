# Love Mondays Front-End Developer Test

Create a HTML page/site from the mockups provided. A partial page mobile mockup has been provided.

Assets are provided in the `assets` directory, and example copy and images can be taken from this[0] webpage.
The fonts to be used are: Source Sans Pro[1] from Google Web Fonts[1].

The resulting page should be delivered with some interactivity:

- when any of the "Acesse" (padlock) buttons is clicked a modal window should appear (see `modal.png`), centered in the viewport.
- when "Entrar utilizando seu email" is clicked in the embedded login box, a form should appear for the user to fill in their email address details.
- The search field (spy glass) in the header should autocomplete text from this JSON service[2].


### Requirements:

Must be delivered as a git repository.

The layout needs to use semantic HTML5 and CSS3 code, and use responsive design concepts.

You must provide a README.md (Markdown) file at the root of your repository, explaining:

- How to compile and run the application.
- How to run the suite of automated tests (unit tests, BDD tests, etc...).
- Which JS libraries you've decided to use for this test, and why you chose them.
